Hej Kim, hej Soren 

To run the solution you might need to change your HTTPD-VHOSTS.CONFIG file: 

# Virtual Hosts
#
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName localhost
  ServerAlias localhost
  DocumentRoot "${INSTALL_DIR}/www/DWP"
  <Directory "${INSTALL_DIR}/www/DWP">
    Options +Indexes +Includes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Require local
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Notes:
About the project, I'm currently working on the Log in usecase but its not working yet. Other than that
my next steps are improving the frontend and add a product picture to my Products table and display it in the productView.
My address table might need some tweaks since I am having trouble implementing it, for now it will be just filled in by the user,
later on I will take out the street field and get the danish postcodes.
